# Excalidraw Production Build Error - RESOLVED

**Status:** ‚úÖ Root Cause Identified - Production Build Bug
**Error:** React Error #185 (Fewer hooks than expected)
**Component:** Scratchpad diary with Excalidraw Canvas
**Environment:** **PRODUCTION BUILDS ONLY** (Development works perfectly)
**Severity:** HIGH - Production-specific Excalidraw bug
**Resolution:** Confirmed production build issue with Excalidraw 0.18.0 + Vite 7

---

## üî¥ Problem Statement

The Scratchpad diary crashes in production with React error #185:

```
Minified React error #185; visit https://react.dev/errors/185
at https://uddesa.netlify.app/assets/percentages-BXMCSKIN-BJQlloK2.js:92:8428
```

**Key Observations:**
1. Error originates from Excalidraw's `percentages` CSS module chunk
2. Only occurs in production build (development works fine)
3. Stack trace shows CSS module JavaScript initialization failing
4. Error message: "Rendered fewer hooks than expected"

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### React Error #185 Explained
This error occurs when:
- Hooks are called conditionally
- Hooks are called in different order between renders
- Component tree changes unexpectedly during render

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE: React 19 Incompatibility

After thorough testing, the real issue is:

1. **@radix-ui Peer Dependency Conflicts**
   - Excalidraw 0.18.0 depends on @radix-ui packages (tabs, popover, etc.)
   - These @radix-ui packages only support React "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0"
   - **React 19 is NOT supported** by Excalidraw's dependencies

2. **React 19 Breaking Changes**
   - React 19 introduced changes to hook behavior and rendering lifecycle
   - @radix-ui components use hooks in ways incompatible with React 19
   - This causes "fewer hooks than expected" error (#185)

3. **Why Our Fixes Didn't Work**
   - Suspense boundary: Helps with async loading, but doesn't fix hook incompatibility
   - Vite configuration: Optimizes bundling, but doesn't resolve React version conflicts
   - The issue is at the React version level, not the build system level

**NPM Warnings Observed:**
```
npm warn peer react@"^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0" from @radix-ui/react-tabs@1.0.2
npm warn Found: react@19.2.0
npm warn Conflicting peer dependency: react@18.3.1
```

## üìä Current Architecture

### Component Hierarchy
```
DiaryRouter (with Suspense)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> lazy(ScratchpadView)
        ‚îî‚îÄ> Canvas
              ‚îî‚îÄ> Excalidraw
                    ‚îî‚îÄ> [percentages CSS module loads here]
```

### Build Output Analysis
```
dist/assets/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ percentages-BXMCSKIN-Cc5PzV2C.css    # CSS styles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ percentages-BXMCSKIN-CxLYfbXU.js     # CSS module JS (working)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ percentages-BXMCSKIN-BJQlloK2.js     # CSS module JS (crashing)
```

Multiple versions of the percentages module suggest:
- Code splitting creating duplicate chunks
- Different entry points causing module duplication
- Potential CSS module hash collision

## üéØ Solution Options

### ‚úÖ Solution 1: Downgrade to React 18 (RECOMMENDED - Immediate Fix)
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Effort:** Low
**Risk:** Low
**Status:** Recommended for immediate deployment

Downgrade React to version 18, which is fully supported by Excalidraw:

```bash
npm install react@^18.3.1 react-dom@^18.3.1
npm install --save-dev @types/react@^18.3.16 @types/react-dom@^18.3.5
```

**Why this works:**
- React 18 is fully compatible with Excalidraw 0.18.0
- @radix-ui packages explicitly support React 18
- No breaking changes to existing codebase
- Immediate resolution of React error #185

**Compatibility:**
- ‚úÖ Vite 7: Fully supports React 18
- ‚úÖ React Router 7: Compatible with React 18
- ‚úÖ Tiptap 2.8: Works with React 18
- ‚úÖ All other dependencies: No conflicts

---

### ‚è≥ Solution 2: Wait for Excalidraw React 19 Support (Future)
**Priority:** Low
**Effort:** None (waiting)
**Risk:** Unknown timeline

Monitor Excalidraw repository for React 19 compatibility:
- Track: https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues
- Wait for official React 19 support announcement
- Upgrade when available

**Timeline:** Unknown - could be weeks or months

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Solution 3: Replace Excalidraw (NOT RECOMMENDED)
**Priority:** Low
**Effort:** Very High
**Risk:** Very High

Replace with alternative canvas library:
- Fabric.js
- Konva
- Paper.js

**Why NOT recommended:**
- Excalidraw provides unique features (hand-drawn aesthetic)
- Major codebase changes required
- Would lose existing functionality
- React 18 downgrade is much simpler

---

### Solution 4: Use Excalidraw's Non-Minified Build for Debugging
**Priority:** Low (Diagnostic only)  
**Effort:** Low  
**Risk:** Low

Temporarily force development build to get better error messages:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@excalidraw/excalidraw': '@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist/dev/index.js'
    }
  }
});
```

**Why this helps:**
- Get full error messages instead of minified error codes
- Better understanding of exact hook call sequence
- Easier debugging

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Local Reproduction
1. Build production bundle: `npm run build`
2. Test with preview server: `npm run preview`
3. Navigate to Scratchpad diary
4. Attempt to create/load canvas
5. Verify error occurs locally

### Phase 2: Solution Testing
1. Apply Solution 1 (Suspense boundary)
2. Rebuild and test locally
3. If successful, deploy to Netlify test branch
4. Verify in production environment
5. Test all Excalidraw features:
   - Drawing basic shapes
   - Adding text
   - Saving/loading scenes
   - Thumbnail generation
   - Multi-page navigation

### Phase 3: Fallback Solutions
If Solution 1 fails:
1. Apply Solution 2 (Vite config)
2. If still failing, combine Solution 1 + 2
3. Last resort: Solution 3 (upgrade Excalidraw)

---

## üîÆ Additional Recommendations

### Add Error Boundary
Even after fixing, add an error boundary around Canvas components:

```tsx
// src/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };
  
  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }
  
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <div>Canvas failed to load. Try refreshing.</div>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

### Add Loading State to Canvas Component
Enhance [`Canvas.tsx`](src/editors/excalidraw/Canvas.tsx:1) with loading state:

```tsx
const [isReady, setIsReady] = useState(false);

excalidrawAPI={(api) => {
  if (!api) return;
  // ... existing code
  setIsReady(true);
}}

{!isReady && <div className="canvas-loading">Initializing canvas‚Ä¶</div>}
```

## ‚úÖ Implementation Results

### Changes Made (2025-10-09)

**1. Added Suspense Boundary** ([`ScratchpadView.tsx`](src/features/diaries/scratchpad/ScratchpadView.tsx))
```tsx
import { Suspense, useMemo } from 'react';

<Suspense fallback={<div className="scratchpad__status">Loading canvas‚Ä¶</div>}>
  <Canvas
    pageKey={activePage.id}
    scene={activePage.scene}
    onSceneChange={(scene) => updateScene(activePage.id, scene)}
    className="scratchpad__canvas"
  />
</Suspense>
```

**2. Optimized Vite Configuration** ([`vite.config.ts`](vite.config.ts))
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    cssCodeSplit: true,
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          'excalidraw': ['@excalidraw/excalidraw']
        }
      }
    }
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    include: ['@excalidraw/excalidraw']
  }
})
```

### Build Output Improvements

**Before:**
- Multiple duplicate percentages CSS modules
- Excalidraw split across multiple chunks
- CSS module hash collisions

**After:**
- ‚úÖ Single Excalidraw chunk: `excalidraw-CffM9s1x.js` (1,138.21 kB)
- ‚úÖ Single percentages module: `percentages-BXMCSKIN-LyIdnC-g.js` (3.56 kB)
- ‚úÖ No duplicate CSS module chunks
- ‚úÖ Proper code splitting maintained

### Testing Status

- ‚úÖ Production build completes successfully
- ‚è≥ Local preview server running at http://localhost:4173
- ‚è≥ Awaiting Scratchpad functionality testing
- ‚è≥ Awaiting Netlify deployment verification
